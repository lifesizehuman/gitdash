# Nathan To-Do List

## Put stuff on Trello

1. Put that I am making/made the UX on uxpin.com and started building it in react.
2. That you started working on the APIs.
3. Anything you can think of for B.S.

Here is a link the ux pin pages.

## Create Database Models

As far as I can tell right now we only need repo and user model
schemas. While we might work with other data, I don't believe we
will save actual data. As is indicated by the response relationship,
users need to be related to repos.
